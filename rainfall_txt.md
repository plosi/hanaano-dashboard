The figure on the left shows the yearly cumulative rainfall. Historical data show an *increase in the total annual precipitations*, in particular from year 2000 onwards.

The figure on the right shows the distribution of the precipitations during the year. The region is characterized by two distinct rainy seasons: the **long rains** from March to May (**MAM**) and the **short rains** from October to December (**OND**). *Long rains are in general wetter, while short rains have higher variability*.

The figure at the bottom represents the monthly rainfall for the selected year, compared to the mean for the selected period. It can be used to identify months with above or below average precipitations.
