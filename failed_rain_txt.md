### Failed Rainy Seasons
Use the slider to set an arbitrary threshold to define a failed rainy season. For instance, if the total amount of precipitation is below a certain percentage of the mean seasonal rainfall, then the rainy season is considered as *failed*.
The chart shows only the rainy seasons that are deemed *failed* according to this arbitrary definition, categorized by long and short.

This is an arbitrary definition and needs to be confirmed against historical observations from literature sources (e.g. droughts, crop fail, etc.).
