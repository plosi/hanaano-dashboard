#### Impact of ENSO/IOD on rainy seasons
- Rainfall during the long rains seasons seem to be little influenced by ENSO and IOD.
- Rainfall during the short rains seasons seem to be influenced by both ENSO (Pearson 0.46) and IOD (Pearson 0.72).
- Failed long rains seasons seem to be weakly influenced by IOD (Pearson 0.3): positive IOD can result in failed season.
- Failed short rains seasons seem to be influenced by both ENSO (Pearson -0.39) and IOD (Pearson -0.46): negative ENSO/IOD can result in faild season.
