### Exploring the impact of ENSO and IOD
Remote teleconnections, namely the El Nino-Southern Oscillation and the Indian Ocean Dipole, exert a dominant influence on interannual variability of rainfall in the area of study.
The IOD and ENSO physically influence Eastern African short rains by modifying regional atmospheric circulation features.

The positive IOD is linked with wetter short rains over Eastern Africa. In contrast, the negative IOD (defined by a sustained negative SST difference of at least 0.4 degC) is associated with weaker short rains.
El Nino conditions (positive ENSO), associated with warmer SST anomalies over the central and eastern Pacific, typically result in wetter short rains, whereas La Nina conditions (negative ENSO), associated with cooler SST anomalies, result in drier short rains.

ENSO's impact on Eastern Africa is, however, strongly mediated by the IOD.
